PnETGenericParameters Value
>>DVPD1				0.02
>>DVPD2				1
BFolResp			0.1 << 0.1 prior to 4/14/2015 (lower values=higher biomass, hi values=lower biomass).  Aber et al. 1996 says 0.1
TOroot				0.016  << GUSTAFSTON uses .02 ? (0.008  my value pre 7/30/2015) (0.008,  my value pre 11/4/2015) 
TOwood				0.008 <<GUSTAFSTON uses .01 ?  (0.016 my value pre 7/30/2015) (0.008,  my value pre 11/4/2015) 
>>Q10					2
>>FolLignin			0.2
>>KWdLit				0.01
>>InitialNSC 			7
>>DNSC				0.15 <<target NSCfraction (0.18 seemed to work good for New England sites). (0.1, my value pre 11/4/2015)
DNSC				0.09  <<target NSCfraction (GUSTAFSTON=0.05) has little effect on cohort competition unless so low that cohort has minimal reserves to survive stress, or so high that species can rarely be stressed enough to die.
MaintResp			0.001 <<(GUSTAFSTON=0.002)value for 10/14 installer= 0.0001  <<effects total biomass in single cell.  lower values increase biomass. 0.0025=gustafson value at one point. (0.000001, my value pre 11/4/2015)
PsnAgeRed			5
EstMoist			2.6
EstRad				2.6
WUEcnst				10.9
>>CFracBiomass			0.5 << C content of biomass
PreventEstablishment	false
>>FrActWd				0.00008 << lower value results in a higher fraction of active wood
>>FracFol				0.05 <<fraction of wood biomass representing max foliage that can be allocated
>>FolAddResp			1
>>H1				0	>> generic: waterlogging threshold. pressure head below which Psn stops because of waterlogging.  Ommitted from model now
>>H2				0 >> generic: waterlogging stress threshold. pressure head below which Psn begins to slow because of waterlogging
>>H3				100 >> species specific water stress threshold (m of pressure head); pressure head above which Psn begins to slow because of water stress. 0.0- < Wiltg point (higher values=more drought tolerant)
>>H4				150  >> species specific wilting point (m of pressure head); pressure head above which Psn stops because of water stress. (higher values=more drought tolerant)
